About the author blurb:
  Manuel Cacho is a lifelong storyteller. A Melody of Crimson Regrets marks the first entry in a fantasy series more than a decade in the making. A passion project in every sense, the novel is the culmination of years spent refining ideas, experimenting with structure, and crafting characters who live in the morally complex space between shadow and light.

  Born and raised in Sacramento, California, Manuel holds a Master of Arts (M.A.) in Spanish from California State University, Sacramento. His deep love of language informs his layered and detail-rich style riddled with subtle themes and narrative ‘easter eggs’ that invite re-reading to reward the keen reader.

  In his free time, Manuel enjoys spending time with his wife and daughter, pursuing hands-on hobbies, and traveling (with a particular love for Japan).
